**The OpenUI5-FHIR project connects the worlds of UI5 and FHIRÂ®. Build beautiful and enterprise-ready web applications based on the FHIRÂ® specification.**

The world of healthcare is in change. Though being a highly regulated industry, more and more solutions move from on-premise into the cloud due to increasing costs. With this, there is a need to standardize communication between all players in the healthcare ecosystem (hospital, insurances, etc.). The [FHIRÂ®](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/index.html) protocol, developed by HL7, has the goal to achieve that. To build UI5 applications based on a FHIRÂ® server, there is a need to provide a UI5 library who enables FHIRÂ® for UI5. The [OpenUI5-FHIR](https://github.com/SAP/openui5-fhir) project provides the *sap.fhir* UI5 library, which fills this gap. Currently, this library provides the *UI5 FHIR Model* which handles the communication with a FHIRÂ® server by a central instance, like the ODataModel does it for OData services. The *UI5 FHIR Model* enables teams to implement fast and full scope UI5 applications based on a FHIRÂ® server. In future, the *OpenUI5-FHIR* project might be enhanced by further FHIRÂ® specific UI5 artefacts.

The complete documentation can be viewed in our [Documentation](https://sap.github.io/openui5-fhir/).

## History

OpenUI5 provides models out of the box, which can be fragmented in client or server-side [models](https://openui5.hana.ondemand.com/#/topic/e1b625940c104b558e52f47afe5ddb4f).
- Client-side models: JSON, XML and Resource
- Server-side models: OData V2, OData V4

Inside the healthcare community there are a few specifications for clinical/medical data. [FHIRÂ®](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/) is one of them. Furthermore FHIRÂ® provides a query language to access and modify the data.

To develop OpenUI5 applications based on FHIRÂ® servers, there is a need to provide an easy to use way to bind the UI to an model which takes care of creating, reading, updating and deleting the corresponding data in the FHIRÂ® server. This is the reason for the brand new *UI5 FHIR Model*, which is included in the *OpenUI5-FHIR* project.

## Features

The *OpenUI5-FHIR* project provides following UI5 artefacts:
- **UI5 FHIR Model**: The FHIRÂ® specific UI5 model implementation to bind UI5 controls to content which is provided by a FHIRÂ® server. The model takes care of requesting, creating, updating and removing FHIRÂ® resources. The application developer doesn't have to care about which requests have to be sent to the FHIRÂ® server at which point in time. The *UI5 FHIR Model* does the job!

## Requirements

The *OpenUI5-FHIR* project is completely integrated into the world of UI5. That means applications built with the *OpenUI5-FHIR* libary can be consumed in any modern browser.

The underlaying FHIRÂ® server has to full following requirements:
- Provide the FHIRÂ® data as JSON

## Download and Installation

The *OpenUI5-FHIR* project is published at npm on package `openui5-fhir`, which includes all necessary files. Add following snippet to your project `package.json` and update the version of `openui5-fhir` to the desired [version](https://github.com/SAP/openui5-fhir/releases).
```json
"dependencies": {
	"openui5-fhir": "X.Y.Z"
}
```
